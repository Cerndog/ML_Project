- to run, execute "python carmela.py" 
- the execution takes about 12 - 15 minutes to run
- you can modify 2 params inside of the main function - pickNFeatures and breakoutFeatures which I current set to 6 and 14 respectively

# select the number of features to pick using feature engineering
   pickNFeatures = 6

# During pre-processing, breakout the 'features' column into the most frequently mentioned features (for example, "cats allowed", "no fee", "doorman", etc.)
   breakoutFeatures = 14

Work that I still need to do:

- remove outliers from 'longitudes'
- Need to finish code to add one more feature engineering method - Principle Component Analysis
